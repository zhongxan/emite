A GWT XMPP (jabber, instant messaging protocol) library.

### 0.5.0 released ###

Changes in this release:
  * GWT 2.0 Ready
  * Basic search functionality
  * Status in room occupants



This library implements the xmpp communications protocol using the [bosh](http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0124.html) technique with gwt. It also handles the xmpp Instant Messaging protocol but has a [modular](http://code.google.com/p/emite/wiki/HowToWriteAPlugin) architecture to support any other kind of communications.

  * stable, pure java (no js), portable library
  * ready, full featured and easy to use instant messaging implementation
  * extensible architecture
  * Chat rooms support ([Multi-User Chat](http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html)).
  * Other XEP like: [Chat State Notifications](http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0085.html).
  * well tested (junit test, coverage support)

### New: Hablar emite ui GWT2.0 ###

  * Common features support (chat, chat rooms, presence, roster)
  * Sound and visual advices when new messages arrive
  * Drag & Drop support to start a conversation and for chat room invitations (emiteui only)
  * i18n support
  * Focused in be very usable
  * Based in extjs and gwt-ext (emiteui)
  * Based in GWT widgets (hablar)

There are also a couple of examples of use in order to learn how to use this library.

We want, in the near future, extend this library to support other protocols (mostly the collaborative editing protocols) and probably other platforms (be able to use it from javascript and j2se -partially done- environments).

This project is the result of a bigger effort to make a collaborative web environment for free/open/libre projects: [kune](http://kune.ourproject.org).
